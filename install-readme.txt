Steps:
1. Run "setup-dependencies.bat"
2. Run "download-modules.bat"
3. Run "bundle-puppeteer-browser.bat"
4. Run "run-server.bat" and enter desired port'
5. Run "run-test.bat" and a browser window will open. (This has been tested only on Google Chrome so Google Chrome is preffered.)

The images are downloaded to Downloads automatically while headless browser is running
(Turn on the "allow multiple downloads" option if prompted in Chrome)

WARNING : DO NOT close server.bat and run-test.bat while you are running tests
